    <h3 id="views">Views mapped to controller actions</h3>

    <p>
        In application bundle, your views get mapped one-to-one to specific controller actions.
        It means, that you don't need to write:
    </p>
    <pre><code>return $this-&gt;render('App:Overview:index.html.twig', array('name' =&gt; $name));</code></pre>
    <p>
        anymore. Just returning context array <code>return array('name' =&gt; $name);</code> is
        enough for RadKernel to understand what view you're refering to. It's like famous
        ExtraBundle, but without annotations :-)
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to help you feel connection between view and action even more, we've
        made <code>Action</code> suffix of actions optionable. As a matter of fact,
        <code>rad:generate:controller</code> command will generate actions without suffix for you.
    </p>

    <pre class="code_block"><code>/**
 * hello action of Default controller.
 *
 * renders App:Default:hello.html.twig
 */
public function hello($name)
{
    return array('name' => $name);
}</code></pre>
